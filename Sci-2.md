# Module 4: Monte Carlo & Randomness â€“ Quick Revision Sheet

## 1. Key Concepts & Formulas

### Random Number Generators (RNGs)
* **Middle-Square Method:** Seed $x_0$, square it, take middle digits; poor period.
* **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG):**
    * Formula: $x_n = (a\,x_{n-1} + c) \bmod M$
    * Full period if: $\gcd(c,M)=1$, $a-1$ divisible by all prime factors of $M$, and if $M$ multiple of 4 then $a-1$ divisible by 4.
* **Mersenne Twister:** Period $2^{19937}-1$, fast, low correlation. Used in many simulations.
* **Blum Blum Shub:** $x_{n+1}=x_n^2\bmod M$. Cryptographically secure but computationally slow.

### Testing Uniformity
* **Mean:** For samples $S_i$ in $[0,1]$, expect $\lim_{N\to\infty}(1/N)\sum S_i = 0.5$.
* **Moments:** Expect $\langle x^k\rangle\approx1/(k+1)$ with error $O(1/\sqrt N)$.

### Monte Carlo Pi Estimation
* Sample points $(x,y)$ uniformly from the square $[0,1]^2$.
* Count the number of points (let's call this $N_{inside}$) that fall within the quarter circle defined by $x^2+y^2\le1$.
* Formula: $\pi\approx4\times\frac{N_{inside}}{N}$, where $N$ is the total number of samples.

### Monte Carlo $\sqrt n$ Estimation
* Sample points $x$ uniformly from the interval $[0,n]$.
* Count the number of points where $x^2\le n$ (let's call this count $N_{valid}$).
* Formula: $\sqrt n\approx n\times\frac{N_{valid}}{N}$.

### Inverse Transform Sampling
* Method to sample from a probability distribution $p(y)$ given its Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), $F(y)=\int_{-\infty}^y p(t)dt$ (or $F(y)=\int_{0}^y p(t)dt$ if defined on $[0, \infty)$).
* Generate a random number $z$ from a uniform distribution $U(0,1)$.
* The desired sample $y$ is obtained by computing the inverse CDF: $y=F^{-1}(z)$.

### 1D Random Walk
* A sequence of steps, each of size $\pm1$, taken with equal probability $p=q=1/2$.
* Position after $n$ steps: $X_n = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$, where $x_i$ is the size of the $i$-th step.
* Mean position: $\mathbb E[X_n]=0$.
* Mean squared displacement: $\mathbb E[X_n^2]=n$.
* Root Mean Square (RMS) displacement: $\sqrt{\mathbb E[X_n^2]} = \sqrt{n}$.

### Monte Carlo Integration
* Method to estimate the definite integral $I=\int_a^b f(x)dx$.
* Sample $N$ points $x_i$ uniformly from the interval $[a,b]$.
* Estimator formula: $I\approx(b-a)\frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)$.
* The error typically decreases as $O(1/\sqrt{N})$, regardless of the dimension of the integral, making it advantageous for high-dimensional problems.

### Histograms & Binning
* **Purpose:** To visualize the distribution of a dataset.
* **Steps:**
    1.  Determine the range of the data: $[\min, \max]$.
    2.  Choose the number of bins, $k$.
    3.  Calculate the bin width: $\Delta = (\max-\min)/k$.
    4.  Define bin edges: $b_0=\min, b_1=\min+\Delta, \dots, b_k=\max$.
    5.  Count the number of data points falling into each bin $[b_{j-1}, b_j)$.
    6.  Plot the counts (or frequency/density) against bin centers or edges.

## 2. Flashcards

* **Q:** Write the formula for a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG).
    **A:** $x_n=(a\,x_{n-1}+c)\bmod M$.

* **Q:** Name two modern Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) and state a typical use case for each.
    **A:** Mersenne Twister (used for simulations due to speed and large period), Blum Blum Shub (used in cryptography due to its security properties).

* **Q:** What is the Monte Carlo formula for estimating $\pi$?
    **A:** $\pi\approx4(N_{inside}/N)$, where $N_{inside}$ is the count inside the quadrant.

* **Q:** How do you use inverse transform sampling to generate samples from an exponential distribution $p(x)=\lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ for $x \ge 0$?
    **A:** Use the formula $x=-\frac1\lambda\ln(1-z)$, where $z$ is a random number drawn from $U(0,1)$. (Note: Since $1-z$ is also $U(0,1)$, $x=-\frac1\lambda\ln(z)$ is often used).

* **Q:** What is the Root Mean Square (RMS) displacement after $n$ steps in an unbiased 1D random walk?
    **A:** $\sqrt{n}$.

* **Q:** What is the estimator formula for Monte Carlo integration of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$?
    **A:** $(b-a)\times \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)$, where $x_i$ are sampled uniformly from $[a,b]$.

* **Q:** What are the conditions for an LCG to have a full period $M$?
    **A:** 1. $\gcd(c,M)=1$. 2. $a-1$ must be divisible by all prime factors of $M$. 3. If $M$ is a multiple of 4, $a-1$ must also be a multiple of 4.

* **Q:** Why is Monte Carlo integration particularly useful in high dimensions?
    **A:** Its convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ is independent of the number of dimensions, unlike many deterministic methods (e.g., grid-based quadrature) which suffer from the "curse of dimensionality".
